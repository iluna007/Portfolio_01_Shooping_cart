Portfolio_01_Shoping_cart
Overview This project is a Shopping Cart Web Application built with React and Vite, demonstrating a dynamic and responsive frontend architecture. It includes features such as product listing, cart management, and smooth user interaction through React's component-based structure.

In this new branch, I am creating a personalised hook.

Technologies Used:

React: For building the UI.
Vite: For fast development and optimized builds.
JavaScript: Core functionality.
How to Run:

Clone the repository.
Run npm install to install dependencies.
Run npm run dev to start the local development server.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh
