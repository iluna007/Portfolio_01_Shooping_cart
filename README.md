# Portfolio_01_Shooping_cart

Overview
This project is a **Shopping Cart Web Application** built with **React** and **Vite**, demonstrating a dynamic and responsive frontend architecture. It includes features such as product listing, cart management, and smooth user interaction through React's component-based structure.

Technologies Used:
- **React**: For building the UI.
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality.

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the local development server.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
